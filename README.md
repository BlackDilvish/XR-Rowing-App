# XR Rowing App
The XR application that was developed in the Unity game engine with extensions supporting the creation of extended reality applications and uses spherical materials collected by the author for an immersion effect. It can be used as a boating simulator while working on a rowing ergometer.
Project realised as a bachelor thesis by [Gabriel Naleźnik](https://github.com/BlackDilvish) in the care of supervisor [Bartłomiej Rachwał, PhD. Eng.](https://github.com/barrach).

## Video mode
In this mode, the spherical video is used as a skybox and plays when the user performs an oscillating movement on a rowing ergometer.
